# The time complexity of this code is O(n),
# where n is the total number of elements in both arr.
# The code iterates over the two arr simultaneously using two pointers,
# comparing the elements and merging them into a single sorted list. Since each element is visited only once,
# the time complexity is linear with respect to the total number of elements, resulting in O(n) complexity.
