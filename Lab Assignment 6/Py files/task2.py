# The code reads a graph from an input file, where the first line contains the number 
# of vertices and edges, and the following lines contain the edge data 
# (two vertices and the weight of the edge between them). The graph is represented
# as an adjacency list using a dictionary. The code then reads two source vertices 
# from the input file. It uses Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest path 
# from each source vertex to all other vertices in the graph. The function
# uses a priority queue to select the vertex with the smallest distance at each step. 
# After finding the shortest paths, the code iterates over all vertices to find 
# the vertex that has the maximum shortest path distance from the two source 
# vertices. This is the vertex that takes the longest time to reach from both 
# source vertices. The time to reach this vertex and its index are written to an output file.
