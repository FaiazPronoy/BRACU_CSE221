# The code reads a graph from an input file, where the first line contains the number 
# of vertices and edges, and the following lines contain the edge data 
# (two vertices and the weight of the edge between them). The graph is represented
# as an adjacency list using a dictionary. It uses Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find 
# the shortest path from each source vertex to all other vertices in the graph. 
# It keeps track of visited points and tentative distances, updating paths as 
# needed until all points are explored.The function alsouses a priority queue 
# to select the vertex with the smallest distance at each step.  Finally, it 
# writes the shortest distances to a new file, marking unreachable points with "-1".
